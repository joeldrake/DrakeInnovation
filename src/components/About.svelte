        Greetings,
        <br />
        I am a web developer focusing on web apps and user interfaces. I
        consider myself front end, because that is what I enjoy. But I have
        experience and knowledge of setting up full tech stacks.
      </p>
      <!--       <p>
        With a background of working in a big north american tech company
        (OpenText) and then co-creating and building a Startup (Infoping) I have
        learned valuable business insights.
      </p> -->

      <p>
        When I got in to
        <b>React</b>
        a couple of years ago my love for web development seriously took off,
        and I haven't looked back since. Since 2019 I work with a team building
        a web app for a big retail company in Sweden. This project is in
        <b>Vue</b>
        which have been fun to learn more about. In personal projects I have
        started using
        <b>Svelte</b>
        because it's an interesting project.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, my preferences for doing a front end web architecture is
        not bound to any specific framework or tool. I am versatile and can work
        in most settings. What I consider important is a
        <b>scalable system</b>
        (both in terms of code and design) that can grow in chunks, for a
        <b>fast and lightweight</b>
        delivery to the end user.
        <b>Accessibility</b>
        is something I always keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to setup a new project today I would opt for using
        <b>Next.js</b>
        to build a React site, using
        <b>Typescript</b>
        to ensure a sustainable developer workflow, and prevent bugs down the
        line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read more about my work below, or get in touch with me to talk more
        about my view on what makes a good web experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best Regards,
        <br />
        Joel Drake
